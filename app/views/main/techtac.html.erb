  <h3>Advantages of Slimline</h3>
  <p>Tech TACâ€™s patented Slimline Tubing Anchor Catcher provides all the benefits of a standard tubing anchor catcher, while improving well efficiencies. Among the many benefits of the Slimline TAC is the smaller diameter and tapered flow deflectors.</p>

<br />

  <p>The patent protected Slimline TAC is able to greatly increase well production and decrease down time. Flow capacity is increased beyond what is provided by a standard TAC for the following reasons </p>
  <ul>
    <li>1. Smaller Overall Diameter</li>
    <li>2. Tapered Flow Deflectors</li>
  </ul>

<br />

  <p>Due to the smaller overall diameter, our Slimline TACs provide less restriction in the well, which allows natural gas to break out easier and makes the pump less likely to gas lock. A standard size tubing anchor, being closer to the size of the casing, restricts the natural gas flow up the annulus.

Located on top and bottom of the TAC, our flow deflectors reduce flow turbulence as well as reduce the lip where dirt and debris can build up, making the well operate more efficiently.

In worst-case scenarios, it may be necessary to cut over or mill up a TAC.  Our Slimline TAC is able to fit inside a shoe mill, which significantly reduces cutver time.</p>

<p>Benefits of the Slimline TAC include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overall reduced diameter from standard TAC</li>
  <li>Increased flow through the annulus</li>
  <li>Reduced area for debris collection</li>
  <li>Reduced gas locking</li>
  <li>Top and bottom flow subs to reduce flow turbulence</li>
  <li>Option to set in or below perforations</li>
  <li>Fits inside a mill shoe</li>
  <li>Dramatically decreases cut over time</li>
</ul>
